# Q-Promises

The purpose of this small respository is to maintain a selection of example uses of [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) for reference and learning.

Kriskowal's tutorial is fine, but a few examples from a third party never hurt anyone :)

# Installation

First, using npm, run `npm install --dependencies` to install the dependencies, and simply run the example you'd like to see the result of using node like so:

`node mimicked-delay.js`

# Example Finder

* **I just want to see a really basic chaining example**
  * See [`mimicked-delay.js`](https://github.com/basicallydan/q-examples/blob/master/mimicked-delay.js)
* **I want to see an example of how to make an HTTP Request, then process the Response, and then do something with the processed response**
  * See [`request-with-processing.js`](https://github.com/basicallydan/q-examples/blob/master/request-with-processing.js)
* **I have some functions that can happen simultaneously, and others which must happen in a certain order - how do I do that?**
  * See [`wait-for-multiple-promises.js`](https://github.com/basicallydan/q-examples/blob/master/wait-for-multiple-promises.js)
