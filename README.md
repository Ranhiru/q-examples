# Q-Promises

The purpose of this small respository is to maintain a selection of example uses of [https://github.com/kriskowal/q](Q) for reference and learning.

Kriskowal's tutorial is fine, but a few examples from a third party never hurt anyone :)

# Installation

First, using npm, run `npm install` and simply run the example you'd like to see the result of using node like so:

`node mimicked-delay.js`

# Which example should I be looking at?

If you'd like to see a really simple example which mimics behaviour of an application with processes which require deferred processing, and which handle errors in the process, see `mimicked-delay.js`

If you're interested in **making HTTP requests and then processing the response in some way** before displaying a result, see `request-with-processing.js`
